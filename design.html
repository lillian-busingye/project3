            <p><strong>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in
                    the

            <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
                I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
                I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>

            <p>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave
                me
                the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world
                and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.

            <p>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
                particular, was outstanding.
                It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often
                referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience.
                It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                recommend! ”</p>
